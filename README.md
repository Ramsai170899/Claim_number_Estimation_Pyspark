Claim Count Estimation - Actuarial Data Science

•	Addressing the Motor Insurance line of business, this project aims at Estimating the Number of Insurance claims.

•	For any insurance company it helps in maintaining its claim settlement ratio(CSR) in foreseeing the claim counts.

•	Comparison between Negative binomial Regression model and a sequential Artificial Neural Network model trained on Crash Analysis System(CAS) dataset. 

•	Large Scale Predictions Scenario using pyspark API – 30Million+ predictions made in less than 1 and half minute.
